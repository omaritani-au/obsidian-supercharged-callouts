## Showcase

See what's possible with Supercharged Callouts. From simple aesthetic tweaks to complex, functional dashboards, you have the tools to build notes that work for you.

### 1. Design Your Own Callouts

Stop searching for the perfect callout and start creating it. The settings panel gives you full control to design callouts that match your exact workflow, complete with custom colors and any of the 800+ icons from the Lucide set.

### 2. Apply Beautiful Vault-Wide Themes

Instantly change the feel of your entire vault. The selected style applies to all callouts—standard, custom, and multi-column—for a beautiful, consistent appearance.

**`Clean Box` Theme:**

### 3. Create Versatile Multi-Column Layouts

Break free from the single-column limit. The plugin supports standard columns, or you can elevate your layouts by using your own personally-designed callouts as columns.

**Standard Columns:**

### 4. Build Powerful Dashboards

## Roadmap & Future Vision

This plugin has a solid foundation, but the journey is just beginning. Here are some of the features planned for the future:

-   [ ] **Advanced Column Widths:** Individual width controls for each column to create asymmetric layouts (e.g., sidebar + main content).
-   [ ] **Inline "Badges" or "Pills":** A third content type for creating small, colorful inline tags like `[!!icon|label|color]`.
-   [ ] **Advanced Layout Engine:** Evolve beyond simple columns to include options for Grid, Masonry, and more.
-   [ ] **Drag-and-Drop Reordering:** An alternative to the arrow buttons for reordering columns and nested callouts.
-   [ ] **Settings Page UI Overhaul:** Redesign the settings page for an even cleaner and more searchable management experience.

## About the Development

This plugin was born from a simple idea and grew into a truly ambitious project. Its development has been a unique collaboration between myself and an AI assistant.

-   **My Role:** As the project architect, I drove the vision, designed the user experience, and performed the critical debugging. I identified the core features, directed the refactoring of the codebase, and rigorously tested each component to find subtle bugs in the UI and rendering logic. My role was to guide, refine, and validate, ensuring the final result was stable, functional, and polished.
-   **AI Collaboration:** The AI served as a powerful pair programmer. I tasked it with generating initial code blocks, implementing well-defined functions, and handling the often tedious process of writing boilerplate code. This provided a rapid first draft, which I then iterated upon, corrected, and integrated into the larger project structure.

This partnership allowed for an incredibly fast development cycle, turning a complex concept into a feature-rich plugin. It's a testament to how human vision and AI execution can work together effectively.

### Acknowledgements

This project was heavily inspired by the creativity and functionality of the following amazing community plugins:
- **Multi-column Markdown plugin by `ckRobinson`:** The original inspiration for integrating multi-column functionality.
- **Editing Toolbar plugin by `cmenu`:** Its clean UI for custom callouts provided a fantastic reference for building an intuitive user experience.
